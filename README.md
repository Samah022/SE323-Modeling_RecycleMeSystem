# SE323-Modeling_RecycleMe_System

This system will be in the form of a mobile app that will be available to those who live 
in Medina. Using this system, materials can be easily recycled from reputable sources. 
The customer can place recycling orders and earn points for their transactions. Later, 
these points will be checked in the system and exchanged for offers. Besides, the 
customers will be able to see their levels on the leaderboard, in addition to their positive 
influence on the environment, which will raise people's social awareness and make it 
easier for them to achieve a high-quality environment. Further, the admin will be able 
to add the offers that will be exchanged with points by customers and generate a report 
about the app's statistics. For the application's delivery representative, the drivers will 
be able to pick up customers' orders to start the recycling life of the materials added by 
customers.
